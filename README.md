# HTML, CSS

This repository contains a collection of HTML and CSS projects, ranging from beginner-friendly layouts to more advanced designs. It serves as a personal learning archive and a showcase of front-end techniques and styling practices.

## 🧱 What are HTML and CSS?

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to structure content on the web. It defines the layout and elements of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is used to style and visually enhance HTML content. It controls colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, animations, and responsiveness — making websites not just functional, but beautiful and user-friendly.

Together, HTML and CSS form the foundation of all modern websites and web applications.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository is organized into multiple folders, each containing standalone HTML/CSS projects. These projects reflect different stages of learning — from basic HTML tags to advanced layouts and animations.

In the following sections, we will go through each folder and briefly describe its contents and purpose.

---

### 📂 01-HTML-Fundamentals

This folder contains **two beginner-level HTML projects**, showcasing the foundational concepts of HTML. These projects demonstrate:

- Use of basic tags like `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, etc.
- Structuring content semantically
- Working with lists, links, and images

These projects were created during the initial phase of learning HTML and are intended to build familiarity with essential syntax and page structure.

### 📂 02-CSS-Fundamentals

This folder continues from the **HTML fundamentals projects** and introduces the basics of **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**.  
The goal is to apply **fundamental styling techniques** to the previous HTML structures, making the pages visually appealing and structured.

this folder contains two projects : 📁 project1, 📁 project2
In this projects, we begin styling the HTML content with CSS basics, including:

- Resetting default margins and paddings  
- Setting a consistent font family and color scheme  
- Creating a header with navigation links  
- Adding styled headings, paragraphs, and lists  
- Applying hover and active states to links  

Key concepts used:
- CSS selectors (`element`, `.class`, `#id`)  
- Pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:active`, `:visited`)  
- Pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::first-letter`)  
- Basic layout using margins, paddings, and positioning

### 📂 03-CSS-Layouts

This folder focuses on **CSS layout techniques**, showcasing three different approaches: **Float**, **Flexbox**, and **Grid**.  
Each method is demonstrated through simple projects that continue from the previous folders.

#### 📁 float

The **float** property in CSS allows elements to be placed on the left or right side of their container, letting text and inline elements wrap around them.  
Although widely replaced by modern layout systems, floats are still useful for understanding the history of CSS layouts.

- **📁 project1**  
  A simple layout where elements are aligned using the `float` property.  
  Demonstrates clearing floats and basic page structuring.

- **📁 project2**  
  An extended version of project1, adding more sections and refining the float-based design.  

Key concepts:
- `float: left;` and `float: right;`  
- The `clear` property to prevent overlap  
- Using floats for multi-column layouts  

#### 📁 flex

The **Flexbox** layout module provides a more modern, flexible way to align and distribute space among elements in a container.  
It is especially useful for creating responsive layouts.

- **📁 project1**  
  A basic page layout demonstrating the use of a flex container with items aligned horizontally.

- **📁 project2**  
  Adds vertical alignment, spacing, and more complex flex properties to structure content effectively.

Key concepts:
- `display: flex;`  
- `justify-content` for horizontal alignment  
- `align-items` for vertical alignment  
- Flexible boxes that adapt to screen size  

#### 📁 grid

The **CSS Grid Layout** is a powerful system that allows developers to create complex, two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns.

- **📁 project1**  
  A simple grid demonstrating row and column definitions, with items placed into specific grid cells.

- **📁 project2**  
  A more advanced example with multiple sections, showing how to span rows and columns for a structured layout.

Key concepts:
- `display: grid;`  
- `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`  
- `grid-gap` for spacing  
- `grid-column` and `grid-row` for positioning items  

💡 These three layout techniques — Float, Flexbox, and Grid — build a strong foundation for modern web design.  
Each project here gradually improves the page structure, helping to understand the evolution of CSS layouts.
