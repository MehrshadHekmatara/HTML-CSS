## üß± What are HTML and CSS?

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to structure content on the web. It defines the layout and elements of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is used to style and visually enhance HTML content. It controls colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, animations, and responsiveness ‚Äî making websites not just functional, but beautiful and user-friendly.

Together, HTML and CSS form the foundation of all modern websites and web applications.
